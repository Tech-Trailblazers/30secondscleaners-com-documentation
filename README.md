# 🧼 30Seconds Cleaners SDS / MSDS Documentation

**“Safety in 30 seconds — knowledge that protects.”**

This repository is a curated, community-powered archive of **Safety Data Sheets (SDS / MSDS)** for products from **30Seconds Cleaners**. Our goal: make chemical safety data open, usable, and impactful for families, researchers, educators, and communities.

---

## 📘 What Are SDS / MSDS?

Safety Data Sheets (SDS, historically also called MSDS) are standardized technical documents created by chemical manufacturers. They typically contain information about:

- 🧪 Chemical composition and ingredients
- ⚠️ Hazard classifications, warnings, and pictograms
- 🚑 First aid instructions
- 🔥 Firefighting measures and reactivity
- 🧯 Safe handling, storage, and usage
- ♻️ Procedures for spills, disposal, and cleanup

When someone’s exposed or a chemical emergency happens, these sheets are lifelines of information.

## 🎯 Why This Repo?

While 30Seconds Cleaners publishes product safety info, this data is often:

- Scattered across multiple web pages or PDFs
- Not easily searchable or machine-readable
- Difficult to compare or cross-reference between products

We created this repository to:

- **Collect & centralize** SDS / MSDS for 30Seconds products
- **Convert & standardize** documents into structured formats
- **Open up access** so educators, AI systems, responders, and households can use them
- **Empower communities** with transparent chemical safety knowledge

This isn’t just an archive — it’s a resource for actionable awareness.

## 🗂 Data Organization & Format

Our structure balances **original documents** with **machine-readable formats**:

- 📄 **PDFs** — Original SDS / MSDS filings
- 🗃 **Structured Data** — JSON, YAML, or CSV with fields like `product_name`, `version`, `hazards`, `composition`, `first_aid`, `handling`, `storage`
- 📋 **Index / Metadata Files** — e.g., `index.json` or `products.csv` listing records, metadata, paths
- 🕓 **Version History** — Where multiple versions exist, each SDS is preserved with a timestamp or version tag

This dual format ensures both **faithful reference** and **machine usability**.
